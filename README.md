# Image Colorization
**Simone Toso, Francesco Zane**

The goal of this report is to implement two approaches
to image colorization. We follow two different approaches,
based on the minimization of two different loss functions,
and compare the results. The first approach is based on
MSE minimization. The second approach, proposed by
Zhang et. al, views colorization as a classification task
in which each pixel is classified to its corresponding color.

We implemented both methods using the Pytorch framework and compared the results.
